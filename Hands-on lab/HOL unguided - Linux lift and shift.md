# Linux lift and shift hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will migrate an on-premises based help desk application called OsTicket, to Azure. This will be a two-phase project to lift-and-shift the application into Azure IaaS and then migrate it to Azure PaaS. The application is Linux based using Apache, PHP and MySQL (LAMP). During the process of these phases, you will ensure zero data loss.

By the end of the hands-on lab you will be better able to configure Linux VMs and VM Scale Sets in Azure for availability, storage, and connectivity. You will also be better prepared to migrate data from on-premises to Azure, establish connectivity between multiple regions and on-premises to Azure. You will also learn how to deploy and scale applications to Azure Web Apps on Linux.

## Overview

Fabrikam Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation, based in Japan, provides product design, manufacturing, and repair services of domestic individual or industrial electronics, as well as global support for their customers. 

To avoid any impact from restructured support operations, executives decided to migrate on-premises customer support systems into Microsoft Azure. The hope is that running Linux VMs on Azure should enable Fabrikam to lower costs while sustaining or even increasing availability of the application.

-   **Phase I:** Lift and shift the application from on-premises to Azure IaaS using an auto scaling Virtual Machine Scale Set and a MySQL cluster with 3 nodes

-   **Phase II:** Migrate to PaaS using Azure App Services with a Linux Docker Container and Azure Database for MySQL

**Phase I will result in an environment resembling this diagram:**

![The Phase I diagram has two Resource Groups, which are connected by VNet Peering. The first Resource Group is MySQLVNet, and has MySQL, bitnami, and Linux. The second Resource Group is OsticketVNet, and has Linux, Apache, PHP, and Osticket. ](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image2.png "Phase I diagram")

**Phase II will result in an environment resembling this diagram:**

5.  Export the data from the **osticket** database using the **Export to Self-Contained File** format and name the file **c:\\HOL\\onpremvm.sql**

**Note**: You will get a version mismatch warning, click **Continue Anyway**.

*Exit Criteria:*

-   A connection using MySQL Workbench was made and the osticket database has been successfully exported

## Exercise 2: Migrate to Azure IaaS VM Scale Sets and MySQL cluster

Duration: 90 Minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy the OsTicket application to Azure IaaS. In the first task, you will deploy and configure a MySQL Cluster with multiple nodes. Next, you will restore the database that was exported using MySQL Workbench. After the data tier of your application has been configured you will deploy a Virtual Machine Scale Set. The OsTicket application will be installed on the instances using the Custom Linux Extension and will be self-configuring. The Scale Set will be setup to autoscale and the VMs that spin up will also self-configuring.

    ![In the Setup New Connection dialog box, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image23.png "Setup New Connection dialog box")

3.  Once the Workbench loads, click **Server Status**. Review the details of the cluster. Remember you are connected to the master for the cluster. Run the following query to see the status of the replica nodes in the cluster
    ```
    SHOW SLAVE HOSTS
    ```
4.  Restore the database that you exported from the OnPremVM to the MySQL cluster. Make sure to use the **Import from Self-Contained File** option.

5.  Run a query to on the **ost\_user** table to show that the data was restore to the **osticket** schema (database)

*Exit Criteria:*    

-   A connection using MySQL Workbench was made and the osticket database has been successfully restored

### Task 3: Deploy the Virtual Machine Scale Set for the OsTicket application

1.  Using the portal or the Azure Cloud Shell deploy the following template into a resource group named: **OsTicketVMSSRG**: <https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/linux-lift-shift/scalesetdeploy.json>

**Note**: It is critical that the deployment be to the same Azure Region (location), as your MySQL cluster deployment. If you select the wrong region you will have to delete and redeploy your Scale Set.

2.  Take note of the settings which has the Admin Username and Admin Password:

    -   Admin Username: **demouser**

    -   OS Admin Password: **demo\@pass123**

3.  Open the Virtual Machine Scale Set in the Azure portal. Review the number of instances and the state of the Autoscaling. Take note of the Public IP address.

4.  Browse to the Public IP address of the Scale Set in a new browser tab. What happens?

5.  Enable Scaling Notification to request emails to Administrators and Co-Administrators of this subscription

*Exit Criteria:*

-   The Virtual Machine Scale Set was deployed with the OsTicket application installed, but when browsing to the application is failed to load with a HTTP/500 error (this is due to lack of connectivity to the MySQL Database)

-   The Scale Set has 1-2 instances currently deployed and is configured with rules to autoscale both up and down based on the percentage of processor used

-   The Administrators and Co-Administrators of this subscription will receive an email when a scaling event occurs on this Scale Set

### Task 4: Connect the MySQLVNet to the Scale Sets VNet

1.  The MySQL Cluster and the Scale Set are running in isolated VNets. To bring the OsTicket application online you will need to create a peering between these VNets.

2.  Once the VNet peering has been connected immediately the two networks can see each other. Verify connectivity between the Scale Set and the MySQL Cluster. Open a new browser tab and attempt to connect to the Public IP address of the Scale Set. You should see the Support Center website again.

    ![On the Microsoft Cloud Workshop tab, the Support Center Ticket Center page displays, and Support Center Home is selected. Two buttons display: Open a New Ticket, and Check Ticket Status.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image24.png "Microsoft Cloud Workshop tab")

    -   Username: ***demouser***

    -   Password: ***demo\@pass123***

*Exit Criteria:*

-   A connection between the MySQLVNet and the OSTICKETXXVNET was made using VNet peering

-   When this peering connection was established the ScaleSet can now address the database server

### Task 5: Export the osTicket database from the MySQL cluster

1.  Next on the **LABVM** use MySQL Workbench to connect to the MySQL cluster and export the osticket database. Make sure to use **Export to Self-Contained File**, and name the file **C:\\HOL\\mysqlcluster.sql**.

*Exit Criteria:*

-   A connection using MySQL Workbench was made to the MySQL Cluster and the osticket database has been successfully exported

## Exercise 3: Migrate the OsTicket application from Azure IaaS to PaaS

Duration: 60 Minutes

In this exercise, you will implement Phase II of the migration to Azure. Here you will retire the Azure IaaS implementation and move to Azure App Service and Azure Database for MySQL. The first steps will be to build the MySQL DB and again migrate the data using MySQL Workbench. Then you will create the Azure Web App and connect it to GitHub Repo to download the app using a Docker Container with PHP 7.0.

![The Phase 2 diagram has /OsTicket with an arrow pointing to a Resource Group containing Linux, Docker, osTicket, a web client, and MySQL.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image3.png "Phase 2 migration diagram")

### Task 1: Create the MySQL Database

1.  Use the Azure portal to create a new Azure Database for MySQL in a new resource group named **OsTicketPaaSRG**. The database server a name must be globally unique in Azure. Enter the name **demouser** and password **demo\@pass123** for the credentials.

2.  Once the database server is deployed take note of the server FQDN and the Server Admin Login Name

3.  Next configure the MySQL server to be ready for the **osticket** database that you will migrate by changing the Enforce SSL connection to DISABLED. Next, add a firewall rule that allows all IP addresses to connect (0.0.0.0 -- 255.255.255.255).

4.  Locate the Connection Strings for the Web App and save it to a text file. Make sure to update it based on your configuration if needed

*Exit Criteria:*

-   An Azure Database for MySQL Server was created

-   The FQDN, Server Admin Login Name and Connection string were located and saved for use in future steps

-   The Enforce SSL connection setting was changed to DISABLED

-   A firewall rule was created to allow connections from all IP addresses

### Task 2: Restore the osticket database to MySQL PaaS

1.  On the **LABVM**, connect to the Azure Database for MySQL server you created

2.  Enter the following information to configure to connect:

    -   Connection Name: **\<enter your MySQL Server DNS Name -- found in the connection string \>**

    -   Connection Method: **Standard TCP/IP**

    -   MySQL Hostname: **\<enter your MySQL Server DNS Name -- found in the connection string \>**

    -   MySQL Server Port: **3306**

    -   Username: **\<enter your user name -- found in the connection string\>**

    -   Password: **Click Store in Vault: demo\@pass123**

    ![Fields in the Setup New Connection dialog box are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image25.png "Setup New Connection dialog box")

3.  Once the Workbench loads, click **Server Status**. Review the details of the MySQL PaaS Server.

4.  Restore the database that you exported from the MySQL cluster. Make sure to use the **Import from Self-Contained File** option.

5.  Run a query to on the **ost\_user** table to show that the data was restore to the osticket schema (database). Notice that now the data from the application has been Lifted and Shifted into a MySQL server running in Azure PaaS. This means that there was zero data loss from the move to PaaS.

6.  Move back to the Azure portal and ensure that the osticket database shows in up in the database list

*Exit Criteria:*

-   The osticket database that was exported from the MySQL Cluster was restored to the Azure Database for MySQL Server

-   A query was run showing that there was no data loss

### Task 3: Create the Web App

1.  In the Azure portal, create a new Web App in a new resource group named **OsTicketPaaSRG.** Make sure to choose Linux for the OS and select the PHP 7.0 Docker Container.

*Exit Criteria:*

-   A new Web App was created using the Azure portal. The OS selected was Linux and the Docker Container that was used is PHP 7.0.

### Task 4: Configure the OsTicket Web App

1.  Using the Azure portal, locate and browse to the new Web App

2.  Configure the Connection string of the new Web App to connect to the MySQL osticket database on the PaaS Service

3.  Using your browser and connect to <https://github.com/opsgility/osTicket>. This is a public repo for the OsTicket software. Sign in to your GitHub account or create a new one. Next, Fork the repo to your personal account.

4.  After the repo is forked to your GitHub locate the **include** folder and edit the file named **ost-config.php**. Scroll down to the Database options area of the file and update the text in this file with your MySQL database settings The DBHOST name and the DBUSER should be updated. Once you have updated the text, scroll down enter a command and click **Commit changes**.

    Before:

    ![The configuration options in ost-config.php after the edit.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image27.png "Github After window")

5.  Configure the Web App to deploy the application using your GitHub osticket repo

6.  Connect again to the **URL** for the Web App and the OsTicket System should open. Sign In as an Agent using:

    -   Username: ***demouser***

    -   Password: ***demo\@pass123***

7.  On the **My Tickets** screen click through to one of the tickets. Once again you see that the data from the IaaS installation of the OsTicket system is preserved which means that you have successfully lifted and shifted the application to Azure PaaS!

*Exit Criteria:*

-   The Connection String was successfully configured on the Web App. This connects the Web App to the MySQL DB.

-   The OsTicket Repo was forked to your Github account. The **ost-config.php** file in the **include** directory of this repo was updated with the MySQL connection information for the server and database. These changes where committed to the GitHub repo.

-   The Web App was configured with a Deployment Option to use the your GitHub repo

-   After a successful deployment from GitHub and the proper database connection configurations the Web App loads in a web browser

-   After Signing in to the Web App, you were able to locate the data and verify that the move to PaaS on Azure was successful with zero data loss
