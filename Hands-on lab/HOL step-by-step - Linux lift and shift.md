## Linux lift and shift hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will migrate an on-premises based help desk application called OsTicket, to Azure. This will be a two-phase project to lift-and-shift the application into Azure IaaS and then migrate it to Azure PaaS. The application is Linux based using Apache, PHP and MySQL (LAMP). During the process of these phases, you will ensure zero data loss.

By the end of the hands-on lab you will be better able to configure Linux VMs and VM Scale Sets in Azure for availability, storage, and connectivity. You will also be better prepared to migrate data from on-premises to Azure, establish connectivity between multiple regions and on-premises to Azure. You will also learn how to deploy and scale applications to Azure Web Apps on Linux.

## Overview

Fabrikam Global Manufacturing & Operations Corporation, based in Japan, provides product design, manufacturing, and repair services of domestic individual or industrial electronics, as well as global support for their customers. 

To avoid any impact from restructured support operations, executives decided to migrate on-premises customer support systems into Microsoft Azure. The hope is that running Linux VMs on Azure should enable Fabrikam to lower costs while sustaining or even increasing availability of the application.

-   **Phase I:** Lift and shift the application from on-premises to Azure IaaS using an auto scaling Virtual Machine Scale Set and a MySQL cluster with 3 nodes

-   **Phase II:** Migrate to PaaS using Azure App Services with a Linux Docker Container and Azure Database for MySQL

**Phase I will result in an environment resembling this diagram:**

![The Phase I diagram has two Resource Groups, which are connected by VNet Peering. The first Resource Group is MySQLVNet, and has MySQL, bitnami, and Linux. The second Resource Group is OsticketVNet, and has Linux, Apache, PHP, and Osticket. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image3.png "Phase I diagram")

**Phase II will result in an environment resembling this diagram:**

## Exercise 1: Deploy the on-premises OsTicket VM application

Duration: 45 Minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy a VM using an ARM template that will act as the on-premises installation of the OsTicket application. This will consist of a single Ubuntu Linux 16.04-LTS VM with Apache, PHP and MySQL installed (LAMP). This application is a helpdesk management software that you will lift and shift into Azure. There is sample data in the application that will be retained throughout the two phases of the project.

## Exercise 2: Migrate to Azure IaaS VM Scale Sets and MySQL cluster

Duration: 90 Minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy the OsTicket application to Azure IaaS. In the first task, you will deploy and configure a MySQL Cluster with multiple nodes. Next, you will restore the database that was exported using MySQL Workbench. After the data tier of your application has been configured you will deploy a Virtual Machine Scale Set. The OsTicket application will be installed on the instances using the Custom Linux Extension and will be self-configuring. The Scale Set will be setup to autoscale and the VMs that spin up will also self-configuring.

1.  From the Azure portal, click on the **Cloud Shell** icon on the top navigation

    ![Screenshot of the Launch Cloud shell icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image20.png "Launch Cloud shell icon")

2.  Execute the following command to create a resource group that will contain the MySQL HA environment.

**NOTE:** Ensure you that use the same region as the OsTicket application.

```bash
    az group create --name OsTicketVMSSRG --location "East US"
```

3.  Execute the following command to deploy the ARM template. This command requires a parameter to be passed to the template. In the example, osticketXX is used. Replace that value with a unique value that is lowercase and less than 10 characters.

```bash
    az group deployment create --name OsTicketVMSSRG --resource-group OsTicketVMSSRG --template-uri "https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/linux-lift-shift/scalesetdeploy.json" --parameters vmssName=osticketXX
```
Take note of the credentials for the VMSS

-   Admin Username: **demouser**

-   OS Admin Password: **demo@pass123**

4.  Once the deployment has completed, open the **OsTicketVMSSRG** and review the deployment

    ![In the OsTicketVMSSRG Resource Group blade, in the left pane, Overview is selected. In the right pane, four items display under Name: osticket1 (vm scale set), osticket11lb (load balancer), osticket11pip (public IP address), and osticket11vnet (virtual network).](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image60.png "Resource Group blade")

5.  Open the **Virtual Machine Scale Set** (it has the same name that you passed in earlier as a parameter). Notice that there are two instances (to start out with), which are a part of a VM Scale Set and that autoscaling has been enabled. After some time, it will be scaled down to only one instance given the lack of traffic to the site.

### Task 4: Connect the MySQLVNet to the Scale Sets VNet

The MySQL Cluster and the Scale Set are running in isolated VNets. To bring the OsTicket application online, you will need to create a peering between these VNets. This was the reason that both deployments needed to be in the same regions along with performance hit if they were in different regions.

1.  In the Azure portal, click on **Virtual Networks** followed by **MySQLVNet** and **Peerings**

    ![In the Virtual networks blade, under Name, MySQL VNet is selected. In the Virtual Network blade, under Settings, Peerings is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image68.png "Virtual networks and Virtual Network blades")

2.  Click **+Add**

    ![The Add button is selected in the Virtual Network blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image69.png "Virtual Network blade")

3.  Enter the name **OSTicketPeering** followed by **Choose a virtual network**. Select the VNet you created with your Scale Set (should follow the pattern of ***\<your-scale-set-name\>vnet***). Click **OK**.

    ![In the Add peering blade, the Name field displays OSTICKETPeering, and the Virtual Network (Choose a virtual network) option is selected. In the Choose a virtual network blade, the osticket11vnet virtual network is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image70.png "Add peering and Choose a virtual network blades")

## Exercise 3: Migrate the OsTicket application from Azure IaaS to PaaS

Duration: 60 Minutes

In this exercise, you will implement Phase II of the migration to Azure. Here you will retire the Azure IaaS implementation and move to Azure App Service and Azure Database for MySQL. The first steps will be to build the MySQL DB and again migrate the data using MySQL Workbench. Then, you will create the Azure Web App and connect it to GitHub Repo to download the app using a Docker Container with PHP 7.0.

![The Phase II diagram has /OsTicket with an arrow pointing to a Resource Group containing Linux, Docker, osTicket, a web client, and MySQL.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image4.png "Phase II diagram")

### Task 1: Create the MySQL database

1.  From the Azure portal, click on the Cloud Shell icon on the top navigation.

    ![Screenshot of the Launch Cloud shell icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image20.png "Launch Cloud shell icon")

2.  Execute the following command to create a resource group to contain the MySQL DB, using a region of your choice:

```bash
    az group create --name OsTicketPaaSRG --location "East US"
```

3.  Execute the following command to create a MySQL Database.
  
> **NOTE**: You must choose an unique name for the MySQL server. Replace **osticketsrv01** with a more unique value.

```bash
    az mysql server create --resource-group OsTicketPaaSRG --name osticketsrv01 --location "East US" --admin-user demouser --admin-password demo@pass123 --sku-name B_Gen4_1 --storage-size 51200 --ssl-enforcement Disabled
```
4.  Add an open firewall rule to the database by executing the following command. Ensure you replace the server name with the unique value from the previous step.

```
    az mysql server firewall-rule create --resource-group OsTicketPaaSRG --server-name osticketsrv01 --name Internet --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --end-ip-address 255.255.255.255
```

5.  Once the MySQL database has been deployed, locate and open it from the **OsTicketPaaSRG** resource group using the Azure Portal

6.  Click **Connection Strings**

    ![Under Settings, Connection strings is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Linuxliftandshiftimages/media/image78.png "Settings section")
